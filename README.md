# My GitHub Notes Repository

## ðŸ“˜ About This Repository
I created this GitHub repository to document and version-control everything I learn about **GitHub**, **Git commands**, and general **software development practices**.

The main goal is to build a personal knowledge base where I can record:
- Steps I follow while learning new Git/GitHub concepts  
- Common commands and workflows  
- Mistakes I made and how I fixed them  
- Notes and references for future use
