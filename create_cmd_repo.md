Perfect question 👏 — yes, it’s **100% possible** to create a new GitHub repository **directly from the command line** — **but** you need to have either:

* 🧩 **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** installed, **or**
* Use the **GitHub API** (more complex — not recommended).

Let’s do it the clean & official way using the **GitHub CLI** (`gh`).

---

## 🧰 Step-by-step: Create GitHub repo from terminal

### 1️⃣ Install GitHub CLI (if not already)

Run this on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install gh -y
```

Check it:

```bash
gh --version
```

---

### 2️⃣ Login to your GitHub account

```bash
gh auth login
```

You’ll see prompts like:

```
? What account do you want to log into? GitHub.com
? What is your preferred protocol for Git operations? HTTPS
? Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials? Yes
? How would you like to authenticate? Login with a web browser
```

It will show a code and open a browser — just approve it.
✅ Once done, your CLI is linked to your GitHub account.

---

### 3️⃣ Create a new repository

From your project folder:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/my-first-test-repo
```

Then create the repo on GitHub:

```bash
gh repo create first_test_repo --public --source=. --remote=origin
```

or if you prefer private:

```bash
gh repo create first_test_repo --private --source=. --remote=origin
```

This command will:

* Create the repo `first_test_repo` in your GitHub account.
* Link it automatically as the remote `origin`.
* Keep your local code connected.

---

### 4️⃣ Push your local code

Now push it:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

### 5️⃣ Verify

Open in your browser:

```bash
gh repo view --web
```

This opens your newly created repo 🎉

---

Would you like me to give you a **one-time script** that installs `gh`, logs in, creates the repo, and pushes your current folder automatically (so you just run one command)?
